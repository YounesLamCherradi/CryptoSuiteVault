Goldwasser–Micali cryptosystem Algorithm: An Overview 🤔

Goldwasser–Micali cryptosystem Algorithm stands as a testament to the fusion of number theory and cryptography. It's designed to efficiently utilize Jacobian symbols, which are key in modular arithmetic and cryptographic computations.

Implementation Details 🛠️ A C program implementing the Micali Algorithm. The algorithm hinges on the calculation of Jacobian symbols and their intricate properties.

The Logic Behind the Code 🔍 The code's primary function, jacobiansymbols(int a, int n), computes the Jacobian symbol (a/n). Here's how it aligns with the theoretical principles:

-Initial Checks: The function begins by handling special cases for the values of a - specifically, 0, 1, and 2, each having distinct properties in the context of Jacobian symbols.

-Handling Even Numbers: If a is even, the algorithm repeatedly divides a by 2 (exploiting the (2/n) property) until a becomes odd. The outcome influences the result based on n's congruence modulo 8.

-The Core Loop: The algorithm enters a loop where it repeatedly applies two key principles:

-Swapping a and n: This step is crucial for applying the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, which states that under certain conditions, (a/n) can be replaced by (n/a) or -(n/a). Reducing a Modulo n: This reduction is essential to ensure that a remains within manageable bounds for subsequent iterations. Final Result Determination: The loop continues until a certain termination condition is met, typically when a becomes 1 or 0. The accumulated result reflects the computed Jacobian symbol.

Practical Application in the Code 🧮 In the main function, the Micali Algorithm is applied to an array of integers. Each integer is processed using the jacobiansymbols function, and the result is translated into a binary ASCII sequence. This demonstrates a practical cryptographic application of the algorithm.
