How It Works 🧐

The Solovay-Strassen algorithm makes critical use of Jacobi symbols in its core operation. By comparing Euler's criterion to the computed Jacobi symbol for randomly chosen bases, the algorithm effectively determines the primality of the input number. This process relies on the properties of Jacobi symbols to probabilistically assert whether a number is likely prime or composite.
